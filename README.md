# Iot-based-RFID
In this project, we developed an IoT-based RFID card reader applied in taking attendance in school. The project consists of three files, logger file, setup file, and Arduino-based main file, stored in SD card in the card reader system. Logger file automatically contains all the activity such as when the card reader system boot-up, power off, connected to which wifi, etc. The Setup file contains wifi details, MQTT broker details, etc. The mq_v1.ino file at first configures the wifi and MQTT server details from the setup file automatically. Then read the student record such as student id, time, etc. and convert it to JSON format and upload it to the cloud MQTT broker. If wifi is disconnected, then all details store locally in the logger file. When wifi is connected to the system, it automatically sends the locally stored data to the cloud MQTT broker and deletes the local file.
